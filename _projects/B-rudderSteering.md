For my project team, Cornell Autonomous Sailboat, I was in charge of designing the rudder drive system.
To do this, I expanded on the design from previous years and I made improvements to increase the stability and serviceability of the servo.
For example, I used a servo saver and metal brackets to connect the servo to the mount.
I also machine some connector parts in order to further increase the reliability of the system.
