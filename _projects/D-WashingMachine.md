For a group project, 4 of my classmates and I worked together to pick a problem and try to solve it using a product. We decided to interview people with hand mobility issues who may not have access to electricity. We designed and built a foot-powered washing machine. Although it started out as a somewhat silly idea I think it came together well and it won the judge's choice award at the end of the semester!


This project went through many iterations through rough cardboard prototypes to a final polished product.
