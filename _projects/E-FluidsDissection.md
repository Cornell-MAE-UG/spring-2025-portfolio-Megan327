In my junior year fluids mechanics class, groups of 5 students take apart a device that uses fluids and analyzes how it works. My group got assigned a vacuum cleaner. We all brainstormed how to model the system and what assumptions we should make together. Then, we split up tasks to do. I mainly worked on drawing all the diagrams for our presentation but I also helped out with calculations and troubleshooting. Click here for our video:
