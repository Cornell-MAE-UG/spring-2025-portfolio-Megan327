In my junior year system dynamics class, groups of 4 students investigate a system. My group got chose to take apart a milk frother. We all brainstormed how to model the system and what assumptions we should make together. Then, we split up tasks to do. I worked on documenting the open-loop response. Specifically for the milk frother, it seems to be a step response.
