My name is Megan, and I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University.
I am part of the class of 2027.
In addition to math and science, I enjoy art, music, and other creative crafts.
This summer, I worked at C. B. Fisk helping to manufacture pipe organs. I also researched sustainable 4D weaving at the Hybrid Body Lab.
In the future, I'd love to continue making instruments, work in product design, or work in R&D.
